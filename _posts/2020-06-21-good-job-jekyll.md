title: Good Job Jekyll

Good job [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the team around [Jekyll Admin](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-admin)!

After lots of time away from writing publically for myself, I have come back to it. Not knowing what platform to use, I tried many different ones. 

**Medium**. A truly disappointing experience to say the least. My biggest top gripe: If I contribute content, why should I have to pay to view content?? WTF? It felt like a stab in the back the first time I saw the paywall appear.

**Ghost**. I was stunned by its elegance and UX. I spun up a self hosted instance in a matter of minutes on DigitalOcean. But for a one person show, its overkill. It seems that it is geared for an organization that can pop out articles every day with different writers each. Think a heavily invested content dominated organization... Maybe one day.

**Jekyll**. Tried it years ago. At the time it did it's job. But my biggest overriding complaint was the UX of creating and editing content. All static was a PIA to maintain. Manipulating html, links, etc. It got to be a road block to churrning out any creative content. 

Finally, after much deliberation, I decided to try give Jekyll another go around. Especially, after seeing Jekyll Admin, I was sold back onto it. Its simple, elegant, easy to deploy, and free to host on Github. 

So to this, I dedicate a round of applause to the teams developing these platforms for us to use free of charge!
