Good job Jekyll and the team around Jekyll Admin!

After lots of time away from writing publically for myself, I have come back to it. Not knowing what platform to use, I tried many different ones. 

I tried Medium. A truly disappointing experience to say the least. My biggest gripe though: Why should I have to pay to use the platform that I contribute content too?? WTF? 

Another one was Ghost. I was not disappointed at all with it. I spun up a self hosted instance in a matter of minutes. But for a one person show, its overkill. It seems its geared for company who can pop out articles every day with different writers each. Think newspaper of a truly heavy content dominated company... Maybe one day.

The other one I tried was Jekyll, years ago though. Although it did its job at the time, my biggest complaint was the UX of creating and editing content. All static was a PIA to maintain. 

Finally, though after much deliberation, I decided to try it again. Especially, after seeing Jekyll Admin, I was sold back onto it. Its simple, elegant, easy to deploy, and free to host on github. 

So to this, I dedicate a round of applause to the teams developing these platforms for us to use.
